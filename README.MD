# 📊 Dashboard Template  
A clean and modular dashboard template designed to be **embedded into any project** with minimal adjustments.

## ✨ Features
- 👤 Includes ready-to-use **User Page**  
- 📈 Built-in **Statistics Page** to visualize data  
- ⚙️ **Settings Page** with customizable options (theme, language, sidebar position)  
- 🌙 **Dark Mode Toggle**  
- 🌐 **Multi-language support** (Arabic, English, Spanish, French)  
- 💾 **LocalStorage Integration**: Settings and preferences are saved locally  
- 🧩 **Modular structure** for easy integration into your own apps  

## 🛠️ Installation
1. 📦 Clone or download the repository  
2. 📁 Make sure the following files/folders are in place:  
   - `dashboard.html`  
   - `style/cardStyle.css`, `style/dashboardStyle.css`, etc.  
   - `script/dashScript.js`  
3. 🚀 Open `dashboard.html` in a browser to test locally  
4. 🔌 Integrate your backend or storage solution for user data, stats, etc.

## 🧩 Usage
1. 📂 Modify HTML sections like `users.html`, `stats.html`, and `settings.html` to suit your project  
2. ⚙️ Use the settings page to test theme and language switching  
3. 🌍 To change the default language, go to the **Settings Page → Language**  
4. 🧠 You may replace or connect `localStorage` logic with your own API/backend to persist user settings across devices  

## 🐞 Notes & Considerations
- ⚠️ All settings (theme, language, sidebar position) are saved **locally** in the browser.  
- ⚙️ If you're integrating with a real project, you’ll need to **replace or extend the localStorage logic** with real data storage (database, cookies, session, etc.)  
- 📱 Fully responsive on mobile and desktop  

## 💬 Language Support
🌍 The main language is **Arabic** 🇸🇦. However, you can easily switch between:  
- 🇺🇸 English  
- 🇪🇸 Spanish  
- 🇫🇷 French  

Simply go to the **Settings → Language** section to change it.
